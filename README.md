# Telstra-Zero-Day-Vulnerability-Malware-Mitigation-Python-Job-Simulation
In this task, we will simulate the firewallâ€™s scripting language by using an HTTP Server. You can assume this HTTP Server has no computational requirements and has the sole purpose of filtering incoming traffic.  In the starter codebase, you will find a test script that you can use to simulate the malicious requests to the server.
